## Study and Research
* From August 2018 to July 2023, I conducted my PhD study in Carlson School of Management, majoring in Information and Decision Sciences.
* I was a graduate student in computer science between August 2013 to July 2015. 


## Minnesota impressed me with
* **Snow Storm**: I have gained the skill that how to dig my car out when I wake up in winter morning!
* **Lakes**: so many many many lakes. About ten thousands! You can even find it on your license plate. 
* **Colorful autumn**: especially in Duluth, a small town in north Minnesota, next to Lake Superior.

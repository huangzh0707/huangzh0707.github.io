MSBA 6410 is a required course for the M.S. in Business Analytics program. This course is
designed to prepare aspiring data scientists for the rapidly changing digital environment faced by
companies and their need to discover novel and actionable patterns, enabling data-driven
decision making. Data Science is a growing interdisciplinary field centered on the use of systems,
processes, and analytical methods to extract knowledge or insights from data in various forms.
The disciplines of Data Mining, Machine Learning, Statistics, and Visualization play a central role
in the analysis of data across the business landscape, and therefore are integral components of
this course. Students will learn a sampling of fundamental and widely used exploratory data
analytics techniques and methodologies. Additionally, students will also have hands-on
experience with these analytics techniques in a variety of business applications—using modern,
state-of-the-art tools—supported by real-world datasets. At the end of this course, students will
be empowered to use exploratory data analytics to discover, visualize, and disseminate nonobvious
patterns about real-world problems. Therefore, we have partnered with Mille Lacs
Corporate Ventures (MLCV), to execute a live case competition during the last 4 weeks of this
course.

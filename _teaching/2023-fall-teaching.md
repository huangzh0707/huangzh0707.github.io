Python is one of the most popular, powerful and versatile programming language not just among professional developers but also for business analysts and users from various fields. While Python may be a simple language relative to other alternatives, its power derives from the vast realms of open-source frameworks available for users from various fields where, for example, machine learning (ML) or process optimization matter, thereby making it a formidable tool.
